Graphene for example is only one atom thick, so would it be 2d even if you can pick it up? If this is the case, wouldn\'t this mean that drawings are more 3D because they are probably thicker than one atom. Also, could hair be considered 2d because it is long, but the width is practically nonexistent?', [('A 2-dimensional shape is any shape that has length and breadth, but no height or depth [1]. This means that 2-dimensional shapes are always flat. One way to think of it is that 2-dimensional shapes can be plotted in a graph on the x- and y-axes [2]. 3-dimensional shapes, on the other hand, have length, width, and height (or depth) [1]. A typical 2-D video image, for example, has width and height, but technically no depth.  [3]', 'Anything with length and height, but not volume, is 2D.  These shapes lie on a flat surface and can be thought of as a plane.  [1]  For example, a piece of paper is 2D because it has length and height, but not volume. [5]  It is possible to have 2D images or 2D animation, which is moving art created in a two-dimensional space. [3][4]  In 2D animation, individual drawings are put together in a sequence to create the illusion of moving film. [3]')])
