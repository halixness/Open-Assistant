Graphene for example is only one atom thick, so would it be 2d even if you can pick it up? If this is the case, wouldn\'t this mean that drawings are more 3D because they are probably thicker than one atom. Also, could hair be considered 2d because it is long, but the width is practically nonexistent?', [('A 2-dimensional shape is any shape that has length and breadth, but no height or depth [1]. This means that 2-dimensional shapes are always flat. One way to think of it is that 2-dimensional shapes can be plotted in a graph on the x- and y-axes [2]. 3-dimensional shapes, on the other hand, have length, width, and height (or depth) [1]. A typical 2-D video image, for example, has width and height, but technically no depth.  [3]', 'Anything with length and height, but not volume, is 2D.  These shapes lie on a flat surface and can be thought of as a plane.  [1]  For example, a piece of paper is 2D because it has length and height, but not volume. [5]  It is possible to have 2D images or 2D animation, which is moving art created in a two-dimensional space. [3][4]  In 2D animation, individual drawings are put together in a sequence to create the illusion of moving film.

What would be the legal basis for such a lawsuit?\n\nI think DACA\'s legal authority stemmed from the Executive Branch employing "prosecutorial discretion" in that the US simply does not have the resources to enforce its laws on everyone.  Therefore, the President chooses which cases the US should spend it\'s resources investigating and prosecuting.  No knowledgeable person (I hope) expects the US to round up millions of people and place them in Immigration Courts. \n\nThat being said, if the current administration wants to play Pokémon, and try to catch em all...it seems perfectly legal.  It seems unwise as it pertains to resource allocation, and heartless in regards to childhood arrivals that are culturally American, but I don\'t see a basis for such a lawsuit from a state (or an individual).', [('The New York Attorney General could sue the United States over the impending discontinuation of the DACA policy for several reasons. One is that the Constitution gives the president the power to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed" [3]. This means that the president and his administration have the power to decide who should be targeted for deportation and who should be allowed to stay in the country [3]. Another reason is that the program was created by President Obama via an executive order, and President Trump moved to end the program in September [1, 2]. However, a federal judge ruled against Trump, saying that the administration\'s contention that the DACA program had not been put into place legally was "unpersuasive" [2].', 'The Trump administration is expected to announce on Tuesday that it will end the so-called Dreamers program, known as DACA, but give the US Congress six months to craft legislation to replace it. [1, 2] New York and Washington state have vowed to sue President Donald Trump if he scraps DACA. [2] \n\nIf he moves forward with this cruel action, New York State will sue to protect the ‘dreamers’ and the state’s sovereign interest in the fair and equal application of the law,” said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.
